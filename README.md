## 🏦 Bank Loan Analytics Dashboard

The dashboard consists of three main sections:

- **Summary**  
  Provides an overall snapshot of loan performance, including total loan applications, funded amounts, amount received, average interest rates, and average debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. It also displays the proportion of good vs. bad loans, along with Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) indicators.

- **Overview**  
  Visualizes trends and distributions of loan applications by time (monthly), purpose, loan term, home ownership status, employment length, and geographical region. This section helps uncover demand patterns and borrower segmentation.

- **Detail**  
  An interactive table displaying individual loan records, including ID, loan purpose, interest rate, installment amount, and payment status. It is equipped with dynamic filters, allowing users to explore specific cases or segments in greater detail.
